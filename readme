This web application is created using the Django framework. This application allows you to perform C.R.U.D. (create, read, update, and delete) functionality with social authentication integration from social providers, specifically Google, Github, and Facebook. 

Getting Started

To use django-auth(project name for our LstMovies Web App), you will need Python 3 and Django 3 or later installed on your system.
Clone the repository:
	$ git clone https://github.com/AngelasGH/django-auth.git
Navigate to the project directory:
$ cd django-auth
Install django-allauth library for our social integration: 
	$ pip install django-allauth
Run the application: 
$ py manage.py runserver 
(application can run in 'localhost' and '127.0.0.1' but it is needed to run our application in  'localhost:8000'  for us to seamlessly logged in our LstMovies because Facebook doesn't allow ‘127.0.0.1’ to logged in using that url)
